# Smart-Automation-Control-Multi-Sensor-Stepper-Motor-System
This repository contains the firmware and documentation for an integrated control system using an Arduino Uno. The project demonstrates how to interface industrial-grade sensors (Capacitive and Inductive) with high-torque motion control (Stepper Motor) and power electronics (Dual Relay Switch).
